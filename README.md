# FanclubMitro Twitter Bot

Welcome to the official Aleksandar Mitrovic Fan Club Twitter application, built with PHP and automated using YAML workflows. This application is dedicated to sharing facts and updates about the talented Serbian footballer and his team, Fulham FC.

My application interacts with other users posting about Mitrovic and Fulham, and regularly posts facts about the footballer taken from a PHP library array in the assets folder. The goal of this application is to bring fans of Mitrovic and Fulham together and keep them informed about the latest news and updates.

The code for the application is open-source and available on GitHub for anyone to use or contribute to. If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to open an issue or pull request.
